# DS400AITutor
The AI tutor is designed to leverage large language models fed with information by professors to act as a 24/7 study budy for students needing help
The goal of the AI tutor is to provide a solution which is available whenever to supplement office hours and in-person tutoring
To make it distinct from a generic large language model or AI chatbot, it will be fed notes by a professor so the tutor is teaching only what the professors wants taught

Planned workflow:
    Get a large language model capable of reading PDF notes functional to code and generates responses to query according to fed info
    Ensure the model generates responses prioritizing the notes assigned
    Ensure the model will not answer homework questions directly but lead to answers
    Give the professor the ability to enable question answering if desired
    Ensure functionality with math (math GPT?)
    Test multiple models for better results -Min viable Backend
    Make simple GUI for professor and student side -Min viable product
    Allow professors to see notes fed to the model on GUI, enable/disable certain sections from questioning
    Allow tutor to create quizzes to test students with mock tests -Desired product
