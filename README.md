# DS400AITutor
The AI tutor is designed to leverage large language models fed with information by professors to act as a 24/7 study budy for students needing help
The goal of the AI tutor is to provide a solution which is available whenever to supplement office hours and in-person tutoring
To make it distinct from a generic large language model or AI chatbot, it will be fed notes by a professor so the tutor is teaching only what the professors wants taught
